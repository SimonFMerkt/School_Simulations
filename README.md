Simulations for explaining and visualising physics concepts for middle school and high school teaching.

These simulations aren't meant to be extremely robust or high performing. The goal is to quickly show examples to middle school and high school students: explainning physical phenomenons while giving exposure to numerical simulations and coding.

The first simulation is of the molecular model for gasses and their diffusion: 2 gasses mix when a dividing wall is removed.
diffusion.py runs the simulation and visualizes the gas particles with an interactive Dividing Wall which can be removed. diffusion_parameters.yaml specifies the parameters which can be changed to illustrate different scenarios (different temperatures, different number of particles...)

The second simulation shows the difference between an undamped oscillator and a damped oscillator. Phase space representation and energy graphs are included
